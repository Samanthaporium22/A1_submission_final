            Ethnicity: Aboriginal <br>
            Education: Certificate III in Business, 2011 <br>
            Languages spoken: Kriol, English
          </p>
          <p>
            Music is my passion, and the most incredible experience so far was watching Dimmu Borgir play at the Roundhouse in London while on holiday in 2018.
          </p>
          <p>
            We also have two black cats, Fluffers and QT McWhiskers named after two characters in Futurama. We have had them for around six years, and they are very demanding.

					<h1>Interest in IT</h1>
				</div>

				<div class="sectionContent">
					<p>My interest in IT began around 2007 when I bought my first computer and created my first character in the World of Warcraft. </p>
          <p>I did a certificate in Software applications at Tafe. However, I had to put further study on hold as I later was accepted for a business administration traineeship on the same campus. During my traineeship, I got the chance to work in the IT helpdesk, logging calls and helping with basic troubleshooting.
          </p>
          <p>Later I commenced at the University of Western Australia as a Human Resources Assistant. I benefited from understanding the software used in my line of work. Excel is an essential tool to customise reports. I enjoy helping my team troubleshoot issues such as processing issues in Ascender, Mail merges in Microsoft Word, Pivot, and Vlookup in Excel, or providing direction with system updates. We have many platforms that feed off Ascender. As a Staff Resources Officer and in my mid 30's, I'm ready to take the plunge into online study while working in my full-time job. </p>
          <p>

          During the Pandemic, I had some health issues which forced me to take a step back from my work and evaluate what I wanted in life.
          I learned that a few colleagues have studied through OUA and chose to look at what was available online, as attending classes on campus would be very difficult given my work and health. </p>
          <p>
          Working at a University, I am aware of RMIT's place on the QS Top University Rankings, and the RMIT ABC Fact Check in the news.
          I gathered all my courage and eventually settled on trying 1 unit with RMIT, Introduction to Programming with RMIT. </p>
          <p>
          I enjoyed the experience of learning the life of the student and am motivated to learn more about IT. I have a good memory when it comes to data or software and keen to develop my skills in software.
          Studying while working is demanding, but I am using this experience to manage my time more effectively. I love learning new things and would like to know about SQL and database management in time.

				<h1>Personality Profile</h1>
				<img src="mbt-lady.png" alt="mbt-lady" />
			</div>

			<div class="sectionContent">
				<article>
					<h2>Myers Briggs Type Indicator INFJ-T</h2>
					<p>The results can be considered as a good representation of my personality. This personality type indicator describes a reserved and shy person that is comfortable observing rather than talking. Intuitive in a way that suggests imaginative and curious. Sensitive and emotionally expressive who can be empathetic to others. Can be a decisive and organised person that prefers to structure and plan.</p>
					<h3>Strengths</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Creative</li>
            <li>Insightful</li>
            <li>Principled</li>
            <li>Passionate</li>
            <li>Altruistic</li>
          </ul><br>
          <p>My strengths give me the confidence to speak out and ask questions as I now have a demonstrated ability within my work to feel comfortable clarifying plans within a team.
            I like to know deadlines, roles, and processes.
          </p>



        	<h3>Weaknesses</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Sensitive to criticism</li>
            <li>Reluctant to open up</li>
            <li>Perfectionistic</li>
            <li>Avoiding the ordinary</li>
            <li>Prone to burnout</li>
          </ul>
          <br>
          <p>I am aware of my weaknesses, as they have previously negatively affected my work life. Learning new strategies over the years has helped me to prevent my weaknesses from adversely affecting my life.</p>
          <p>I am mindful of habits or thoughts and try to keep a good balance in life while also reminding myself to be kind and apply boundaries when working with others. </p>
          <p>When I receive criticism, I don't take it personally and try to take away a lesson to improve. I am a true introvert but try to keep open communication when collaborating with others.
          </p>

					<h3>Team Composition</h3>
					<p>They are comfortable creating new ideas, making decisions, and organising major projects. The Advocate is a negotiator in support of the team objectives. She prefers to work in a structured environment and will take the initiative to plan. When forming a team, I am aware of my strengths and am comfortable discussing roles upfront to provide clarity within the team. I'm not a leader as I prefer to observe but can act as a support to the leader as needed.</p>

				<h1>Project Idea</h1>
			</div>

			<div class="sectionContent">
				<article>
					<h2>Overview</h2>
					<p>This project will essentially design a tool that can empower staff. We will construct a chatbot that could be a valuable tool to support staff within HR, Finance, and Staff Resources on services offered, process information, legislation, and policy details offered at UWA.
          </p>
          <p>The chatbot's function would act as a training tool by receiving input from an individual, processing the input, and providing an answer. These could be questions we usually get from customers and colleagues, pointing them in the right direction or giving them resources that could help them find the answers. The chatbot will be trained to recognise topics and keywords and choose the most appropriate and relevant response. This tool would make life easier for individuals in positions such as frontline customer support in large and complex organisations.</p>
				</article>

				<article>
					<h2>Motivation</h2>
					<p>Helping people is a passion and I want to drive the focus of this project towards supporting staff to do their jobs in an efficient and timely manner by creating this tool as a knowledge base that will provide answers.
          </p>
          <p>Chatbots are familiar with large companies that use the technology in online sales or provide basic customer service; I have had many experiences. In my personal experience, there does not appear to be much of this technology used in the workplace to support   internal  staff. The focus and demand seem to be more on how customer experience can be improved within a business and therefore improve the organisation's image.
          </p>
          <p>The Chatbots' classification shows that a chatbot can be developed and have multiple categories and uses.

            <img src="1-s2.0-S2666827020300062-gr3.jpg" alt="chatbotsclassification" />

            (Fig. 3. Chatbots’ Classification., 2020)<br>
            I believe chatbots can improve services provided to staff to make their lives easier, and I would like to explore how we can develop a chatbot as a training tool.</p>
				</article>

				<article>
					<h2>Description</h2>
					<p>The project is based on the documentation produced by Gunther Cox, and the process flow diagram is a good starting point.
            <img src="chatterbot-process-flow.svg" alt="chatterbot-process-flow" />
             (Cox, n.d.)
          </p>
          <p>
             To address the points in the diagram.<br>
             <ul>
               <li>API: A web API would be sufficient on SharePoint.</li>
               <li>Console: Console will be in the web browser.</li>
               <li>Speech recognition: The Web Speech API contains text to speech, or TTS (Using the Web Speech API - Web APIs | MDN, 2022)</li>
               <li>Logic adapter: We would need to create an FAQ to map out solutions and trigger phrases to include in the code.</li>
             </ul>

          </p>
          <h3>Features of the chat bot</h3>
          <p>The chatbot could act as a purpose-built training tool for internal staff to assist them in answering queries that would not usually come up very often.
					</p>
					<p>The chatbot can be personalised to interact seamlessly according to the organisation's standards with staff, and it could resemble a human-to-human conversation. It is possible to process written input and provide audio responses with text-to-speech availability.
					</p>
					<p>Features 24-hour availability (Dilmegani, 2022) as it will be posted online in SharePoint. Instant responses (Dilmegani, 2022) will be provided online, and it can multitask if multiple people engage it. Due to the non-delay of responses, efficiency could increase work processing. (CHATBOTS ARE HERE TO STAY So what are you waiting for?, 2017)
					</p>
					<p>Consistent answers are provided, and we can ensure the answers built into the code are in line with the Business values and quality check if needed. Reduced costs as it does not require an annual employee salary with fewer resources required.
					</p>
					<p>Over time we can expand chatbot understanding and services, making it more efficient. Feedback from staff interactions with the chatbot can be used to increase engagement. Recorded interactions can provide invaluable data to the organisation to understand roadblocks or pain points to staff that can be addressed.
					</p>
					<p>There are no emotional exchanges in times of stress as the chatbot will not respond to any angry responses. We could include training the chatbot to respond appropriately to de-escalate the situation if needed.
					</p>
					<p>In the year 2022, younger people are more likely to want to find the answer to their questions themselves online before asking a human. Shy or introverted personality types may prefer chatbot interactions to a human.
					</p>
					<p>FAQs and surveys can be reviewed within the organisation to provide regular updates to code. Chatbots have multiple use-cases, which means we can create multiple chatbots to serve different purposes if there is a need for them, as shown in the Chatbots' Classification earlier.</p>
				</article>

				<article>
					<h2>Tools and Technologies</h2>
					<p>As described in the description, I have addressed the main points in the process flow diagram.
					A web API would be sufficient, which will be on SharePoint. The console will be in the web browser.
					The Web Speech API contains text to speech, or TTS (Using the Web Speech API - Web APIs | MDN, 2022).
					We would need to create an FAQ to map out solutions and trigger phrases in the code.
					</p>
					<p>
					First, we need a terminal to write python language and import library as described in the Chatterbot library and documentation (Cox, 2022).
					A Python code editor will be sufficient such as Python IDLE or Visual Studio Code.
					Web API will be on SharePoint, which is included in Microsoft 365.
					The Python web framework used will be Flask; I have not had much experience using this. Git hub can manage version control.</p>
				</article>

				<article>
					<h2>Skills Required</h2>
					<p>Intermediate skill in writing Python is sufficient, and further code support can be provided by the python documentation and the Chatterbot library and documentation (Cox, 2022) I believe we can produce this with average skills in writing HTML, but I am not entirely sure how much skill will be needed in Java. Intermediate skills in Computer literacy are required.</p>
				</article>

				<article>
					<h2>Outcome</h2>
					<p>If the project is successful, it would have a tool that could be used to answer questions instantly. Eventually, it would upskill staff or become a daily tool to provide repetitive answers to common questions and be trained over time to answer complex questions.
          </p>
          <p>The original issue of training and support would be filled with this tool, and staff will be empowered to carry out their jobs knowing they can ask questions any time of the day and get an answer straight away. Productivity could improve, and morale in the teams would increase.
          </p>
